# Yelp-Restaurant-Review-Analysis
A research indicates that a one-star rating increase out of 5-star led to 59% increase in revenue of independent restaurants. Therefore, we see great potential of 
Yelp dataset as a valuable insights repository.

The project focuses on determining if customers like the food by performing an analysis on different cuisines of restaurants and the reviews they have received on Yelp.
After analyzing different restaurants we recommend restaurants to the customers based on their liking with the help of Machine-learning models(KNN,SVD).
